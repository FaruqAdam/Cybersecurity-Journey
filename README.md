## Introduction

Adam Umar Faruq is my name and I am a graduate of Computer Science. My journey into Tech started in 2014 when I got my first laptop and possessed unsatiable curiosity. I wanted to know everything and everything fascinated me. 

I got admitted to study Computer Science at the Polytechnic, and that was my starting point. Over the years, I have dabbled into so many aspects of tech that I sometimes consider myself a generalist but that is not the case. To mention a few:

- Software Engineering. 
- UI/UX Design
- Physical Networking
- A couple of programming languages including Java, Javascript and Python.
